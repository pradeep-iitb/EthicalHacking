# Browsing Data & Privacy
**Browsing Data** is the digital trail you leave behind while using the internet.
* **Components:**
    * **History:** A list of every URL you have visited.
    * **Cache & Cookies:** (As defined above).
    * **Saved Passwords/Form Data:** Auto-fill information.
* **Privacy Implications:**
    * If you don't clear this data, anyone with access to your computer can see where you've been.
    * Websites use this data to target ads at you.
* **Protection:** Using "Incognito" or "Private" mode prevents the browser from saving History, Cache, or Cookies locally, but it **does not** hide your activity from your internet provider or employer.
**Encryption** is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
* **The Goal:** Confidentiality. It ensures that even if someone steals your data, they cannot read it without the "key."
* **In Browsing:** You see this as the **padlock icon** (HTTPS) in your address bar. It means the conversation between your computer and the website is scrambled so hackers on the Wi-Fi cannot read your credit card numbers or passwords.

## Cache (Web Cache)
**Definition:** A temporary storage area on your computer where your browser saves parts of websites you visit, such as images, logos, and scripts.
* **The Goal:** Speed.
* **How it works:** When you visit a site for the second time, your browser loads the images from your hard drive (Cache) instead of downloading them again from the internet. This makes the page load much faster.
* **Analogy:** It’s like keeping your most-used tools on your desk rather than putting them back in the shed every time you use them.

## Cookies
**Definition:** Small text files that websites save on your computer to remember information about you.
* **The Goal:** Continuity and Identification.
* **Types:**
    * **Session Cookies:** Temporary. They let the site remember you are logged in as you move from page to page. They disappear when you close the browser.
    * **Tracking Cookies (Third-party):** Used by advertisers to follow you across different websites to build a profile of what you like to buy.
* **Analogy:** A "wristband" given to you at a club so the bouncers know you've already paid the cover charge.

## Encryption
**Encryption** is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
* **The Goal:** Confidentiality. It ensures that even if someone steals your data, they cannot read it without the "key."
* **In Browsing:** You see this as the **padlock icon** (HTTPS) in your address bar. It means the conversation between your computer and the website is scrambled so hackers on the Wi-Fi cannot read your credit card numbers or passwords.


## SSL/TLS & HTTPS
**Definition:** **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) and its modern successor **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.
* **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):** When a website uses SSL/TLS, the URL starts with `https://` instead of `http://`, and you see a padlock icon.
* **Why it matters:**
    * **Encryption:** It creates a secure tunnel. If you enter a password or credit card number, it travels as unreadable code (ciphertext).
    * **Authentication:** It proves the website is legitimate and not a fake "spoof" site.

## Autofill
**Definition:** A browser feature that automatically fills in forms (names, addresses, credit cards, passwords) using data you have previously saved.
* **Pros:** Convenience and speed.
* **Cons (Security Risk):**
    * **Physical Access:** If you leave your computer unlocked, anyone can use your autofill to log into your accounts or buy things.
    * **Malicious Scripts:** Sophisticated phishing sites can sometimes use hidden fields to trick your browser into "autofilling" more data than you intended to share.
* **Best Practice:** Use a dedicated **Password Manager** instead of browser-based autofill for sensitive data.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
**Definition:** A service that creates a secure, encrypted connection to a different network over the internet.
* **How it works:**
    1. It hides your **IP address** (your digital location) by routing your traffic through a server in another country/city.
    2. It encrypts your internet traffic before it leaves your device.
* **Primary Uses:**
    * **Privacy:** Prevents your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or websites from tracking your location and browsing history.
    * **Security:** Essential when using **Public Wi-Fi**. It stops hackers on the same Wi-Fi from intercepting your data.

# Safe Browsing Practices
These are the habits required to keep your data safe, regardless of the software you use.

* **Verify the URL:** always check the address bar. Is it `amazon.com` or `amaz0n.com`?
* **Update Software:** Keep your browser and operating system updated to patch security holes.
* **Avoid Suspicious Links:** Hover over links in emails before clicking to see the actual destination URL.
* **Use Ad-Blockers:** Malicious ads ("Malvertising") can sometimes infect computers just by loading on the page.
* **Log Out:** When using public computers, always log out and clear the browsing data.
