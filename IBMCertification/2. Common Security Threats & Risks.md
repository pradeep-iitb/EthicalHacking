# Common Security Threats & Risks

Begin your cybersecurity journey by understanding the foundational concepts. This module covers the distinctions between data, information, and insights and introduces prevalent security threats such as ransomware, malware, data theft, and unauthorized access.

# The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** stands for **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**, essential components of a comprehensive security program.

## Confidentiality
* **Definition:** Ensures data is protected from unauthorized access, preventing risks like identity theft and legal issues.
* **Security Measures:**
    * Controlling data access.
    * Using tools like **encryption** and **multifactor authentication (MFA)**.

## Integrity
* **Definition:** Guarantees that data remains accurate, complete, and consistent, protecting against unauthorized changes.
* **Types of Data Integrity:**
    * **Physical:** Protecting storage systems.
    * **Logical:** Preventing human error and hacking.

## Availability
* **Definition:** Ensures authorized users have reliable access to data, addressing threats from hardware failures and malicious attacks like DoS.
* **High Availability Systems:** Use network monitoring, redundant hardware, and backup servers to maintain access.

## Regulatory Standards
* Organizations must comply with regulations like **HIPAA** and **GDPR** to secure data.
* Includes penalties for non-compliance to ensure data safety and privacy.

# Key Concepts in Data and Security

## Intellectual Property (IP)
* **Definition:** Refers to creations of the mind, like inventions, designs, and artistic works.
* **Analogy:** Think of it as a unique recipe that someone has created; it’s valuable and needs protection from being copied without permission.

## Data vs. Information
* **Data:** Like raw ingredients in cooking—just numbers or facts, such as sales figures or website visits.
* **Information:** When you process data, it becomes information. It is like a finished dish that tells you something meaningful, like how well a restaurant is doing.

## Confidential Information
* **Definition:** Sensitive information that needs to be kept secret.
* **Examples:** Personal details like your address or medical records.
* **Protection:** Companies protect this information to keep it safe from unauthorized access.

## Data Analytics
* **Definition:** The process of examining raw data to find patterns or insights.
* **Analogy:** Imagine you’re a detective looking for clues in a mystery; data analytics helps businesses make informed decisions based on trends they discover.

## Digital Products
* **Definition:** Non-physical items that a company owns, like software or eBooks.
* **Protection:** Just like a musician wants to protect their songs from being copied, companies need to safeguard their digital products from piracy.

## Data Capture and Correlation
* **Data Capture:** Collecting information from various sources, like customer surveys or website logs.
* **Correlation:** Finding connections between different data points, similar to how a detective connects clues to solve a case.

## Confidentiality Practices
* Companies must handle confidential information carefully.
* **Best Practices:**
    * Using strong passwords.
    * Encrypting data.
    * Ensuring only authorized people can access sensitive information.

# Different types of Malicious Software or Malware

**Malware** (Malicious Software) refers to any software specifically designed to harm, exploit, or disrupt a device, service, or network.

## 1. Infectious Malware (Spreads)

### Virus
* **Definition:** A piece of code that inserts itself into a legitimate program or file (the "host").
* **Behavior:** It remains dormant until the user opens the host file. Once active, it replicates and infects other files on the system.
* **Key Feature:** Requires a **host file** and **user action** to spread.

### Worm
* **Definition:** A standalone program designed to replicate itself to spread to other computers.
* **Behavior:** It uses network vulnerabilities to jump from machine to machine automatically.
* **Key Feature:** Does **not** need a host file or user interaction; spreads via **networks**.

## 2. Concealment Malware (Hides/Tricks)

### Trojan Horse (Trojan)
* **Definition:** Malware disguised as legitimate, useful software (e.g., a free game or antivirus update).
* **Behavior:** Once installed by the tricked user, it performs malicious actions in the background, such as opening a "backdoor" for hackers.
* **Key Feature:** Relies on **social engineering** (deception); does **not** self-replicate.

### Rootkit
* **Definition:** A collection of tools that enables a threat actor to gain unauthorized control of a computer system (administrator/root access).
* **Behavior:** It hides deep within the operating system to avoid detection by standard antivirus software.
* **Key Feature:** Designed for **persistence** and **stealth**.

## 3. Profit & Extortion Malware

### Ransomware
* **Definition:** Malware that blocks access to a system or encrypts data until a sum of money is paid.
* **Behavior:** It scrambles files using strong encryption. The attacker provides a decryption key only after the ransom is paid (usually in cryptocurrency).
* **Key Feature:** **Data encryption** and financial extortion.

### Spyware
* **Definition:** Software that secretly monitors a user's computing habits.
* **Behavior:** It collects data such as browsing history, emails, and usernames without the user's knowledge.
* **Key Feature:** **Silent monitoring** and data theft.

### Adware
* **Definition:** Software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material like banners or pop-ups.
* **Behavior:** Often bundled with free software; while annoying, it can also track user behavior (crossing into spyware territory).
* **Key Feature:** **Intrusive advertising**.

### Cryptojacking
* **Definition:** Unauthorized use of a victim's computer to mine cryptocurrency.
* **Behavior:** It runs in the background, using the computer's CPU/GPU power, causing the device to slow down and overheat.
* **Key Feature:** **Resource theft** for financial gain.

## 4. Specific Function Malware

### Botnet
* **Definition:** A network of infected computers ("zombies" or "bots") controlled remotely by a hacker ("bot herder").
* **Behavior:** The individual computers function normally, but the hacker can command the entire group to perform actions like a DDoS attack (flooding a website with traffic to crash it).
* **Key Feature:** **Distributed control** for large-scale attacks.

### Keylogger
* **Definition:** A type of surveillance technology used to record keystrokes.
* **Behavior:** It captures every key pressed, effectively stealing passwords, credit card numbers, and messages.
* **Key Feature:** Records **input** directly.

### Logic Bomb
* **Definition:** Malicious code inserted into a program that lies dormant until a specific condition is met.
* **Behavior:** When the "trigger" event occurs (e.g., a specific date or an employee being fired), the malicious code executes (e.g., deleting a database).
* **Key Feature:** **Trigger-based** execution.
