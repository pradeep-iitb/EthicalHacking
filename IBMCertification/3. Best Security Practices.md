# Authentication vs. Authorization

These two terms are often used together, but they represent two distinct steps in the security process. The easiest way to remember the difference is: **Authentication** is about *who you are*, and **Authorization** is about *what you can do*.

## 1. Authentication (AuthN)
* **Definition:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system.
* **Question:** "Who are you?"
* **Goal:** To ensure the user is who they claim to be.
* **Common Methods:**
    * **Something you know:** Passwords, PINs.
    * **Something you have:** Smart cards, USB keys, smartphones (for OTP).
    * **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprint, FaceID, iris scan).

## 2. Authorization (AuthZ)
* **Definition:** The process of granting or denying specific permissions to an authenticated user.
* **Question:** "What are you allowed to do?"
* **Goal:** To ensure the user only accesses resources they are approved to see.
* **Context:** This happens *after* authentication.
* **Examples:**
    * A regular employee can *view* a document, but a manager can *edit* it.
    * Accessing a specific folder on a shared drive.

## Analogy: The Airline Trip

1. **Authentication (The Check-in Counter):** You show your passport and ticket. The airline confirms **you are who you say you are**.
2. **Authorization (Boarding the Plane):** The flight attendant checks your boarding pass. They let you onto the plane (access granted) and show you to your specific seat (permissions). You are **authorized** to sit in seat 12A, but you are **not authorized** to enter the cockpit.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Authentication (AuthN) | Authorization (AuthZ) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Identity | Permissions |
| **Timing** | Comes **first** | Comes **after** authentication |
| **User Action** | User provides credentials (password/face) | System checks rules/policies |
| **Example** | Logging into a computer | Opening a specific file |
| **Status** | You are valid or invalid | You are allowed or denied |

# Authentication Methods and Their Importance

Authentication methods are critical in cybersecurity to verify user identities. The number of layers (factors) involved directly correlates to the security level.

## 1. Single Factor Authentication (SFA)
* **Definition:** Requires only one credential to verify identity, typically a username and password.
* **Vulnerabilities:**
    * Highly vulnerable to threats like keystroke loggers and phishing.
    * If an attacker obtains the username and password, they can access the account without restriction.

## 2. Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
* **Definition:** Involves two credentials to grant access.
* **Mechanism:** Often combines a password with a physical device, like a security key or a smartphone app.
* **Benefits:** Enhances security against phishing and account hijacking.
* **Modern Evolution:** Newer 2FA methods utilize **NFC technology** (Near Field Communication), allowing for easier access without needing to physically plug in a device.

## 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* **Definition:** Adds multiple layers of security beyond just two, significantly reducing the risk of breaches and phishing attacks.
* **The Three Factors:** It requires various identification types:
    1. **Something you know** (e.g., Password)
    2. **Something you have** (e.g., Phone, Token)
    3. **Something about you** (e.g., Biometric data like fingerprints)

## 4. Single Sign-On (SSO)
* **Definition:** A convenient authentication process that allows users to access **multiple applications** with just **one set of login credentials**.
* **Benefit:** Reduces password fatigue (users don't have to remember different passwords for every app), though it requires strong protection for that single entry point.

# Digital Accounting

**Digital Accounting** refers to the formation, representation, and transmission of financial data in an electronic format. It replaces traditional paper-based ledgers and manual data entry with software, cloud computing, and automation technologies.

## Core Components

* **Cloud Computing:** Accounting data is stored on remote servers (the cloud) rather than local hard drives. This allows access from any device with an internet connection.
* **Automation:** Routine tasks like bank reconciliation, invoicing, and payroll are performed automatically by software, reducing human error.
* **E-Invoicing:** The automated exchange of invoices between the software of the buyer and the supplier.
* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Technology that scans physical receipts or PDF invoices and converts the text into digital data entries automatically.

## Key Benefits

1. **Real-Time Access:** Business owners and accountants can view financial positions (cash flow, profit/loss) instantly, rather than waiting for month-end reports.
2. **Increased Accuracy:** Automation reduces the risk of "fat-finger" errors associated with manual data entry.
3. **Cost & Space Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for physical storage (filing cabinets) and reduces paper waste.
4. **Integration:** Digital accounting systems easily connect with other business tools like CRM, POS (Point of Sale), and inventory management systems.

## Traditional vs. Digital Accounting

| Feature | Traditional Accounting | Digital Accounting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage** | Physical files & cabinets | Cloud-based servers |
| **Accessibility** | Restricted to office location | Accessible anywhere, anytime |
| **Data Entry** | Manual entry (prone to error) | Automated feeds & OCR |
| **Updates** | Periodic (end of month/year) | Real-time |
| **Backup** | Manual physical backups | Automatic cloud backups |

## Security in Digital Accounting
Since financial data is sensitive, digital accounting relies heavily on cybersecurity concepts:
* **Encryption:** Data is scrambled during transmission.
* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Required to access accounting dashboards.
* **Access Controls:** Ensuring only authorized staff can approve payments.

# Non-Repudiation

**Non-Repudiation** is a legal and technical concept in cybersecurity ensuring that a person or entity cannot deny the validity of something they did. It provides "undeniable proof" of the origin and integrity of data.

## Core Concept
If you send a message or perform an action, Non-Repudiation ensures you cannot later say, *"I didn't send that"* or *"That wasn't me."*

It is often considered the fourth pillar of security, sitting alongside the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

## How It Works
Non-Repudiation is typically achieved through a combination of two technologies:

1. **Digital Signatures:** Just like a physical signature on a contract, a digital signature binds a user's identity to a specific message. If the signature matches the user's public key, it proves *they* signed it.
2. **Audit Logs:** Detailed records of who accessed what and when.

## Analogy: Registered Mail
Imagine sending a letter via **Registered Mail** with a return receipt requested.
* **Authentication:** The post office checks your ID when you send it.
* **Integrity:** The envelope is sealed so no one can change the letter inside.
* **Non-Repudiation:** The recipient signs a receipt upon delivery. You now have physical proof they received it. They cannot claim, *"I never got that letter."*

## Relationship to Other Concepts

| Concept | Question Answered | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Who are you? | Logging in with a password. |
| **Integrity** | Was the data changed? | Checking a file hash. |
| **Non-Repudiation** | **Can you deny you did this?** | **Signing a digital contract.** |

# Encryption Basics

**Encryption** transforms readable text (**plain text**) into an unreadable format (**ciphertext**) using algorithms called ciphers.

* **The Key:** An **encryption key** is essential for scrambling and unscrambling data, ensuring that only authorized recipients can read the information.

## Types of Data

Understanding the state of data is crucial for applying the right encryption strategy.

* **Data at Rest**
    * **Definition:** Stored data (not currently being moved).
    * **Protection:** Can be encrypted at various levels (individual files, entire hard drives/devices, or cloud storage) to protect it from unauthorized access.
* **Data in Motion**
    * **Definition:** Data actively being transmitted over a network.
    * **Risk:** Vulnerable to interception.
    * **Protection:** Using **end-to-end encryption** helps secure this data during transmission.

## Encryption Methods

There are two primary ways to handle the keys used for encryption.

### 1. Symmetric Encryption
* **Mechanism:** Uses a **single key** for both encryption and decryption.
* **Pros:** Faster and efficient.
* **Cons:** Harder to secure because the key must be shared secretly.

### 2. Asymmetric Encryption
* **Mechanism:** Employs a pair of keys:
    * **Public Key:** Used to encrypt data.
    * **Private Key:** Used to decrypt data.
* **Pros:** Allows for secure key exchanges and **digital signatures**.
* **Cons:** Slower than symmetric encryption.
