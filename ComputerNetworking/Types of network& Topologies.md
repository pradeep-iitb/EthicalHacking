# How Data is transferred 

take example of whatsapp when a sender sends a message then whatsapp firstly makes small packets and then encrypt it . If using wifi , (2.4GHz wider range and less speed , 5 GHz radiowave less range and high speed) router provides ip addr to all connected devices , apply NAT (Network Access Translation)- IP (private) --> IP (public) then send to ISP and then to Whatsapp server and follwing the same above to receiver .

# Types of Networks -

| Network Type | Range/Area | Speed | Usage | Khasiyat (Pros) | Buraiya (Cons) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PAN** (Personal) | 1–10 meters | Low | Personal devices (phone, watch) | Low cost, easy to use, wireless | Very short range, low security |
| **LAN** (Local) | 1 building/room | High (100 Mbps–1 Gbps) | Home, schools, offices | Fast, secure, easy sharing | Limited to small area, failure risk |
| **MAN** (Metro) | City level | Medium | Cable TV, universities | Connects LANs, city-wide use | Costly, complex, traffic overload |
| **WAN** (Wide) | Global | Medium–Low | Internet, MNCs | Long-distance sharing, global use | Expensive, slow, security risk |
| **CAN** (Campus) | College/corporate campus | High | Universities, tech parks | Secure, high performance | Costly setup, limited coverage |

## Network Topologies

* **Bus Topology:** Single central cable. Easy install, but if the backbone breaks, the network fails.
* **Ring Topology:** Closed loop. Orderly data flow, but one failure affects the whole ring.
* **Star Topology:** Central hub/switch. Easy to fix faults; if the hub fails, the network stops.
* **Mesh Topology:** Interconnected devices. High reliability (redundancy), but very expensive cabling.
* **Tree Topology:** Hierarchical (Star + Bus). Good for distinct branches (departments), but complex.
* **Hybrid Topology:** Combination of topologies. Flexible/scalable, but expensive to design.
