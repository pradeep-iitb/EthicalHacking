# Burpsuite

- **Burp Suite** is a comprehensive web application security testing platform that provides tools for intercepting, modifying, and analyzing HTTP/HTTPS traffic between clients and servers. It's widely used by penetration testers and security researchers to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
- At its simplest, it is a tool that sits between your web browser and a web server, allowing you to intercept, inspect, and modify the raw traffic passing between them.

## The Core Concept: Intercepting Proxy

Burp Suite functions as a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy**.

* **Normal Browsing:** When you visit a website, your browser sends a request directly to the server, and the server sends a response back.
* **With Burp Suite:** You configure your browser to send traffic to Burp first. This allows you to pause the request, see exactly what data is being sent (passwords, cookies, hidden fields), modify it to test for security flaws, and then forward it to the server.

# Setting up and Exploring Burp suite in detail

- For using Burpsuite we have to setup a proxy in browser which sent req to burpsuite instead of server directly . We can use proxy manager of browser for this by confuguring it to host `127.0.0.1:8080` (localhost at port 8080) .
- An easy alternate for the proxy manager is **FoxyProxy** extension .

## Key Tools Inside Burp Suite
Burp is not just one tool but a collection of different tools integrated into a single interface:

* **Proxy:** The heart of the suite. It lets you intercept and modify web traffic in real-time.
* **Repeater:** Allows you to capture a specific web request and send it over and over again, manually tweaking parameters each time to see how the server responds (great for testing logic flaws).
* **Intruder:** An automated tool for performing customized attacks. You can use it to brute-force passwords, fuzz input fields to find errors, or test thousands of common vulnerability patterns. We can select multiple variables and multiple payloads with differnet modes like sniper , pitchfork , etc .
* **Scanner:** *(Professional/Enterprise only)* An automated vulnerability scanner that crawls the application to find issues like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection without manual effort.
* **Decoder:** A utility for encoding and decoding data (e.g., Base64, URL encoding).
* **Comparer:** A visual tool for comparing two different web requests or responses to spot subtle differences.
