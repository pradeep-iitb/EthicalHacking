# Phishing

**Phishing** is a technique where attackers send fraudulent emails appearing to be from reputable sources to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

## Types of Phishing

| Type of Phishing | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deceptive Phishing** | The most common type, where attackers send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources to steal sensitive information. | An email impersonating a bank asking the recipient to update their login credentials. |
| **Spear Phishing** | Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations, often using personal information to increase credibility. | An email tailored for a company employee requesting sensitive data, appearing to come from a CEO. |
| **Whaling** | A form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like executives with very convincing messages. | An email that looks like it's from a government agency requesting financial information from a CFO. |
| **Vishing** | Voice phishing conducted over phone calls, where attackers try to extract personal information through conversation. | A phone call pretending to be from a bank asking for account verification details. |
| **Smishing** | Phishing attempts via SMS text messages, tricking victims into revealing personal information. | A text message claiming to be from a bank asking the recipient to click a link for account updates. |
| **Clone Phishing** | Attackers create an exact replica of a legitimate email but replace the link or attachment with a malicious one. | A cloned email about a software update that contains a link to malware instead of the legitimate site. |
| **Typosquatting** | Using domain names similar to legitimate websites to capture users who make typos when entering URLs. | A fake website like "paypa1.com" instead of "paypal.com" designed to steal login credentials. |
| **Pharming** | Redirecting users to fake websites even when they enter the correct URL, often through DNS poisoning. | Users typing in "bank.com" are redirected to a fraudulent site that looks identical to the real one. |
| **CEO Fraud (BEC)** | Scams targeting businesses where attackers impersonate executives and request unauthorized transactions or sensitive data. | An email from someone posing as the CEO instructing an employee to transfer funds urgently. |
