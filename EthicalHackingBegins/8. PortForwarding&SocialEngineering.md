# Port Forwarding

**Port Forwarding** (or Port Mapping) is a network technique that directs communication requests from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall.

It effectively allows external devices (from the internet) to access services running on a private internal network.

## How It Works
1.  **Incoming Request:** An external user sends a request to the Router's public IP address on a specific port (e.g., Port 80).
2.  **NAT Translation:** The router checks its "Forwarding Table" to see where to send traffic for that port.
3.  **Forwarding:** The router modifies the packet's destination IP to match the internal device's private IP (e.g., `192.168.1.50`) and forwards the data.
4.  **Response:** The internal device replies to the router, which then sends the data back to the external user.

## Common Use Cases
* **Hosting Servers:** Allowing the public to access a web server, game server, or FTP server hosted on a home network.
* **Remote Access:** Enabling RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) or SSH access to a computer from outside the local network.
* **P2P Downloading:** Improving connection speeds for BitTorrent or direct file transfers.
* **Security Cameras:** Viewing internal security camera feeds remotely.

---

## Risks & Security
* **Exposed Services:** Forwarding a port makes that specific service visible to the entire internet. If the service (e.g., an outdated webcam firmware) has a vulnerability, attackers can exploit it.
* **Bypassing Firewalls:** It deliberately punches a hole in the network firewall, removing a layer of protection for that specific device.

## Port Forwarding using ngrok 
``` bash
sudo service apache2 start
cd /var/www/html
nano index.html
ngrok http 80
```

*Other Application like Portmap.io can also be used for the purpose .*

# Social Engineering

## What is Social Engineering?
Social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of individuals to perform actions or divulge confidential information, often for malicious purposes. This tactic exploits human behavior and cognitive biases, making it a significant concern in cybersecurity.

## Phases of Social Engineering Attack
1.  **Research the target company:** Attackers gather information about the organization, such as employees, structure, and technologies used (Reconnaissance).
2.  **Select a Target:** Identifying specific individuals within the organization who are likely to be vulnerable or have the access needed.
3.  **Develop a Relationship:** Building trust and rapport with the target to lower their defenses and make them more willing to help.
4.  **Exploit the Relationship:** Leveraging the established trust to manipulate the victim into revealing sensitive information or performing an action.

## Types of Social Engineering
* **Human Based Social Engineering Attacks:** Relies on direct human interaction to manipulate victims (e.g., impersonation).
* **Computer Based Social Engineering Attacks:** Uses software or computer systems to deceive users (e.g., phishing emails).
* **Mobile Based Social Engineering Attacks:** Targets mobile devices specifically through apps or SMS.

---

## 1. Human Based Attacks
* **Impersonation:** Pretending to be someone else (like an IT support tech or CEO) to gain access or information.
* **Vishing (Voice Phishing):** Using phone calls to deceive victims into revealing personal or financial information.
* **Eavesdropping:** Secretly listening to private conversations to gather sensitive information.
* **Shoulder Surfing:** Looking over someone's shoulder to see their password, PIN, or sensitive data on a screen.
* **Dumpster Diving:** Searching through trash or recycling bins to find discarded documents containing sensitive info.
* **Reverse Social Engineering:** The attacker creates a problem and then convinces the victim that they are the only one who can solve it.
* **Piggybacking:** An unauthorized person follows an authorized person into a restricted area with their consent (often out of politeness).
* **Tailgating:** Similar to piggybacking, but the unauthorized person follows without the authorized person's knowledge.
* **Diversion Theft:** Creating a distraction to steal physical items or information while the victim is occupied.
* **Honey Trap:** Using a fake romantic or attractive persona to lure a victim into revealing secrets.
* **Baiting:** Leaving a physical device (like a USB drive) in a public place, hoping a victim will plug it in out of curiosity.
* **Quid Pro Quo:** Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information (e.g., "I'll fix your computer if you give me your password").
* **Elicitation:** Subtly extracting information during a casual conversation without the victim realizing they are being interrogated.

---

## 2. Computer Based Attacks
* **Pop-up windows attacks:** Windows that appear suddenly to display fake warnings or ads to trick users into clicking.
* **Spam Mail:** Unsolicited junk email that may contain malicious links or attachments.
* **Instant chat messenger:** Sending malicious links or files through instant messaging platforms.
* **Scareware:** Malicious software that scares users into buying fake security software by claiming their computer is infected.
* **Phishing:** Sending fraudulent emails appearing to be from reputable sources to induce individuals to reveal personal information.

---

## 3. Mobile Based Attacks
* **Publishing malicious apps:** Uploading apps with hidden malware to official or third-party app stores.
* **Using security apps:** Disguising malware as a security tool or antivirus app to gain high-level permissions.
* **Repackaging legitimate apps:** Modifying a popular app to include malicious code and re-releasing it.
* **SMishing (SMS Phishing):** Phishing attacks conducted via SMS text messages.

---

## Behavior Vulnerable to Attacks
* **Authority:** People tend to obey instructions from figures of authority (e.g., "This is the CEO").
* **Intimidation:** Using fear or threats to force a victim to comply.
* **Consensus or Social Proof:** People are more likely to do something if they see others doing it.
* **Scarcity:** Creating a false sense of limited availability to pressure a quick decision.
* **Urgency:** Demanding immediate action to prevent the victim from thinking critically.
* **Familiarity or Liking:** Exploiting the tendency to say yes to people we know or like.
* **Trust:** Exploiting the natural inclination to trust others.
* **Greed:** Leveraging the desire for financial gain or free items.
