# DDoS Attacks (Distributed Denial-of-Service)

**Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attacks overwhelm target systems by flooding them with excessive traffic, rendering services unavailable to legitimate users.



## Attack Steps
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Identify vulnerable targets using tools like Shodan.
2.  **Botnet Formation:** Compromise devices (IoT, servers, PCs) to create a network of "zombies."
3.  **Traffic Generation:** Distribute malicious requests across multiple sources simultaneously.
4.  **Target Overload:** Exhaust the target's bandwidth, CPU, or memory resources.

***Tools like the Low Orbit Ion Cannon and Net Strike can be used for such Attacks***

## Attack Types

### 1. Volume-Based Attacks
*Goal: Flood the target with massive traffic volumes to consume bandwidth.*
* **UDP Flood:** Overwhelms random ports on the host with IP packets containing UDP datagrams.
* **ICMP Flood:** Consumes bandwidth by sending a flood of ping requests (ICMP Echo Request) without waiting for replies.

### 2. Protocol-Based Attacks
*Goal: Exploit protocol weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4.*
* **SYN Flood:** Exploits the TCP handshake by sending SYN packets but never completing the connection (ACK), exhausting the server's connection tables.
* **ACK Flood:** Floods the server with ACK packets, forcing it to process each one to check for a non-existent connection.

### 3. Application-Level Attacks
*Goal: Target specific vulnerabilities in web applications (Layer 7).*
* **HTTP Flood:** Overwhelms web servers with legitimate-looking GET or POST requests.
* **Slowloris:** Opens many connections to the target server and keeps them open as long as possible (by sending partial requests), exhausting the server's thread pool.

## Defense Strategies
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement limits on the request frequency at the network edge.
* **CDN Distribution:** Use Content Delivery Networks (like Cloudflare or Akamai) to absorb and filter traffic closer to the source.
* **Anycast Routing:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple data centers to balance the load.
* **SYN Cookies:** A technique to handle incomplete TCP handshakes without consuming server resources.
