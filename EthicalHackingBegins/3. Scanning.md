# What are Ports ?

In computer networking , ports are like doorways or entry points that allow different types of data to flow in and out of a device or network .

Protocols are sets of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received between devices .

## General Ports
| Port | Protocol | Service Name | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **20** | TCP | FTP Data Transfer | Used for transferring files in FTP sessions. |
| **21** | TCP | FTP Command Control | Used for commands and control in FTP sessions. |
| **22** | TCP | SSH | Used for secure remote login and command execution. |
| **25** | TCP | SMTP | Used for sending emails between servers. |
| **53** | UDP | DNS | Used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. |
| **80** | TCP | HTTP | Used for transmitting web pages over the internet. |
| **443** | TCP | HTTPS | Used for secure web traffic, encrypting data between the client and server. |

# NMAP 

*Popular tool for port scanning , os detection , version detection and more .*

``` bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -O scanme.nmap.org
OR
sudo nmap -A microsoft.com
```

# Directory Bruteforcing

Directories on a server refer to folders or containers where files are stored and organised . 

``` bash 
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/common.txt
OR
feroxbuster --url https://microsoft.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt  (recursive)
```

# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weakness and flaws in systems and networks by using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities .

| Scan Type | Description | Access Level | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **External Scans** | Target externally-facing IP addresses to identify vulnerabilities in perimeter and cloud systems. | Public-facing | Assess security posture from an external perspective. |
| **Internal Scans** | Conducted within the organization's network to find vulnerabilities in internal systems and applications. | Internal network access | Identify risks that could be exploited after a breach. |
| **Unauthenticated Scans** | Perform scans without valid credentials, relying on publicly accessible information to find vulnerabilities. | No credentials required | Detect basic weaknesses visible to external attackers. |
| **Authenticated Scans** | Use valid credentials to access deeper layers of the system for a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. | Valid user credentials | Uncover hidden vulnerabilities and compliance issues. |
