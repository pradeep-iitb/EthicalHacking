# Clearing Tracks

- When we get access of any system ( *prefer use https protocols so that system treat it as normal traffic* ) or do anything on the system then it creates log files like system logs , security logs . We can see these logs by `run event_manager -i`  . 
- If access is denied we can get NT authority system by command `get system` and diff exploits . We can clear all the logs by `clearev` . 
- Secondly we can clear tracks by disabling Auditpol by `execute -f cmd.exe -a "/c auditpol /clear" `
- In linux logs are saved in `/var/log/messages` and can be viewd by `head meassges` , but can be cleared by `kwrite messages` 
- All the commands are saved in bash history . We can view history size by `$HISTSIZE` and can be set to 0 by `export $HISTSIZE=0` .
- Also bash_history directory can be permanently deleted and can't be recovered if used `shred -zu /root/.bash_history`

# Become Anonymous while Hacking

## Proxies 

Proxies are intermediary servers that act as gateways between clients and target servers. They intercept and forward network traffic, offering several security and operational benefits. 

## Types of Proxies

**Forward Proxy: Client-to-Server**
* Routes client requests through an intermediary server.
* Used for caching, filtering, and anonymity.

**Reverse Proxy: Server-to-Client**
* Handles incoming requests and distributes them across backend servers.
* Provides load balancing, SSL termination, and caching.

**Transparent Proxy: No Client Modification** Required
* Client unaware of proxy existence (no configuration needed).
* Used for monitoring/filtering.

**Anonymous Proxy: Hides Client Identity**
* Removes client identifying headers (e.g., `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`).
* Blocks access to internal networks.

---

***Key Features***
* **Traffic Inspection:** Analyzes packets for malicious content.
* **Rate Limiting:** Controls request frequency to prevent DDoS.
* **Content Filtering:** Blocks harmful websites/files.
* **Caching:** Improves performance by storing copies of resources.

# VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## Remote Access VPN: Client-to-Network
* Connects individual users to a private network from a remote location.
* Commonly used by employees to access company resources securely from home.

## Site-to-Site VPN: Network-to-Network
* Connects two different networks (e.g., branch offices) over the internet.
* Creates a permanent link, often used for corporate intranet connectivity.

## Client-Based VPN: Personal Use
* Routes user traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a third-party server.
* Used for bypassing geo-restrictions and hiding IP addresses (e.g., NordVPN, ProtonVPN).

---

## Key Protocols
* **OpenVPN:** Open-source standard, highly secure, and configurable.
* **WireGuard:** Newer, faster, and more efficient protocol with lighter code.
* **IPSec/IKEv2:** fast and stable, often used for mobile devices (reconnects quickly).
* **L2TP/IPSec:** Older standard, provides strong encryption but can be slower due to double encapsulation.

---

## Key Features
* **Encryption:** Encrypts data traffic (AES-256) so it is unreadable to ISPs/hackers.
* **Tunneling:** Encapsulates packets inside another protocol for secure transport.
* **IP Masking:** Hides the user's real IP address behind the VPN server's IP.
* **Kill Switch:** Automatically disconnects internet access if the VPN connection drops.


| Feature | Proxy | VPN | Tor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Working** | Acts as an intermediary between client and destination server, forwarding requests. | Establishes a secure, encrypted connection between client and VPN server. | Routes traffic through multiple nodes, using layered encryption for anonymity. |
| **Anonymity** | Masks the user's IP address but does not guarantee true anonymity. | Masks the user's IP address; however, the VPN provider can see the traffic. | Provides true anonymity by concealing the user's identity through multiple layers. |
| **Security** | Varies depending on the type of proxy; generally lacks encryption. | Encrypts all traffic, providing a secure connection against eavesdropping. | Uses multiple layers of encryption, making it very secure but potentially slower. |
| **Ease of Use** | Generally easy to set up and use; often requires minimal configuration. | Typically easy to set up; requires installation of a client application. | More complex to set up and use; requires understanding of how to navigate the Tor network. |
| **Speed** | Generally faster than VPNs and Tor, but speed can vary based on server load. | Offers good speeds, although some reduction may occur due to encryption overhead. | Slower due to routing through multiple nodes, which can significantly affect performance. |
| **Best For** | Bypassing geoblocks or accessing restricted content without strong privacy needs. | General online privacy, secure browsing, and protection against ISP tracking. | High-level anonymity for sensitive activities, especially in restrictive environments. |

***Lets apply proxy in Kali Machine***

``` bash
proxychains
cd /etc/
sudo nano proxychains4.conf
systemctl start tor
proxychains4 firefox
proxychains nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
```

## MAC ADDRESSES

Mac addr can be changed with `macchanger` tool .
