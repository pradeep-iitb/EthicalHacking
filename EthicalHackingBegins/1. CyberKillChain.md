# What Actually **"Hacking"** Is ?

 **Hacking = Curiosity**

Hacking or Hijacking is just outsmarting any system and finding creative ways to make it do something other than its intended purpose .

Ethical hacking is the practice of legally and intentionally breaking into computer systems , networks to  identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them .

## Types of hackers 
* White hat hackers or ethical hackers
* Black hat hackers
* Grey hat hackers
* Script Kiddies
* Hacktivists
* State sponsored hackers

## Types of Testing 

| Testing Type | Knowledge Level | Focus Area | Common Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White Box Testing** | Full knowledge of code | Internal structure & logic | Unit & integration testing |
| **Black Box Testing** | No knowledge of code | Functionality & user experience | System & acceptance testing |
| **Gray Box Testing** | Partial knowledge | Both internal & external aspects | Integration & system testing |

| Team Type | Focus Area | Key Activities | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Red Team** | Offensive security | Simulating attacks, penetration testing | Identify vulnerabilities |
| **Blue Team** | Defensive security | Monitoring systems, incident response | Protect against attacks |
| **Purple Team** | Collaboration between red & blue | Joint exercises, knowledge sharing | Strengthen overall security posture |

# Ethical Hacking Methodology

1. Reconnaissance / Footprinting
2. Scanning
3. Gaining Access
4. Maintaining Access
5. Clearing Tracks

| Phase | Description | Techniques Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reconnaissance** | Gathering information about the target system to identify potential vulnerabilities. | Google Dorking, WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, Social engineering tactics |
| **Scanning** | Using tools to identify vulnerabilities in the target system through various scans. | Network mapping, Port scanning, Vulnerability scanning |
| **Gaining Access** | Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system. | SQL injection, Buffer overflow attacks, Phishing attacks |
| **Maintaining Access** | Establishing a persistent connection to the compromised system to assess the duration of undetected access. | Installing rootkits, Creating hidden user accounts, Tunneling |
| **Clearing Tracks** | Removing traces of the ethical hacker's activities from system logs to understand how attackers might cover their tracks after an attack. | Modifying log files, Deleting evidence of unauthorized access |

# Cyber Kill Chain Methodology 

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponisation
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command & Control
7. Actions on Objectives

| Phase | Description | Techniques Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reconnaissance** | Attackers gather information about the target to identify vulnerabilities. This includes studying public data, websites, and social media. | Scanning for open ports, Collecting data on employees, Identifying security measures |
| **Weaponization** | The attacker creates a malicious payload (e.g., virus, worm) paired with an exploit that targets identified vulnerabilities. | Developing malware, Combining payloads with exploits |
| **Delivery** | The malicious payload is transmitted to the target through various methods such as phishing emails, malicious links, or USB drives. | Sending phishing emails, Utilizing compromised websites for downloads |
| **Exploitation** | Upon successful delivery, the attacker exploits a vulnerability in the target's system to execute the payload and gain access. | Triggering malware, Exploiting software vulnerabilities |
| **Installation** | The attacker installs malware on the victim's system to establish a foothold, allowing for persistent access in the future. | Installing backdoors, Setting up remote access tools |
| **Command and Control** | The attacker establishes a command and control channel to remotely manipulate the compromised system without detection. | Creating communication channels, Sending commands to the installed malware |
| **Actions on Objectives** | Finally, the attacker carries out their primary goal, which may include data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities. | Data exfiltration, Encrypting files for ransom, Disrupting services |
